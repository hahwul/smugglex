## Purpose

These guidelines ensure that documentation for tools is clear, concise, and professional. Follow them to create readable documents suitable for GitHub agents.

## Structure

Organize documentation with the following sections in order:

1. **Overview**: Provide a brief description of the tool's purpose and key features.

2. **Installation**: List steps to install or set up the tool, including dependencies.

3. **Usage**: Explain how to use the tool with examples. Include command-line syntax or API calls.

4. **Configuration**: Detail any required settings or options.

5. **Examples**: Show real-world use cases with code snippets or outputs.

6. **Troubleshooting**: Address common issues and solutions.

7. **References**: Link to related resources or further reading.

Use Markdown headings for sections. Limit subsections to two levels.

## Language and Style

- Write in simple, direct sentences.
- Use active voice where possible.
- Avoid jargon unless defined.
- Keep paragraphs short, no more than five lines.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for steps and lists.
- Spell out acronyms on first use.

## Formatting

- Tables: Use for comparisons or data presentation.
- Links: Embed inline with descriptive text.
- Images: Include only if essential, with alt text.

## Best Practices
